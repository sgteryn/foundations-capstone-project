        <section> </section>
        <p id="aboutdtext">Detroit is one of the most historic cities in the country. It is known for bringing the world the automotive industry, fabulous music, sports and even urban farming. The people of Detroit are know for their grit, resilience and creativity. Detroit is most popularly known as "The Motor City", "Motown" and "Hockeytown." We also affectionately call Detroit, "The D." The D in "D Goods" represents Detroit. Detroit eateries are second to none and we aim to strictly showcase only Detroit Restaurants while highlighting the best Black-Owned restaurants in the city. Many times black-owned business are minimally-represented and lack the resources needed for growth and sustainabilty. We aim to close that gap by helping to market those places to our site visitors and patrons. Now, go ahead and checkout the Restaurants page by clicking "Restaurants" at the top of the page. If you are having trouble figuring out what to try, click the "Pick4Me!" button located at the top right of the screen on the restaurants page to get a randomly selected restaurant from our database for you to try. Go on now, pick a place to eat and help feed the D!</p>
